## LargeNetVis


LargeNetVis is a visualization system  designed to assist in analyzing small and large temporal networks.

The system leverages three taxonomies focused on network communities to guide the visual exploration process.

## Video demonstration

Follows a video to demonstrate the LargeNetVis system main funcionalities.

* This Twitter network has 50,514 nodes (Twitter users) and  108,132 edges distributed in 224 timestamps, each comprising a 1-h interval.
* When using 100 timeslices for analysis, the network is decomposed into 2,033 communities.
* The selected community represented in the super node-link diagram (D) has 3,886 nodes and 5,035 edges.
